# Enhancing-Low-Resolution-Images-to-High--Resolution-SRGAN
This project is an implementation of SRGAN (Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Network), a deep learning model for upscaling low-resolution images into photo-realistic high-resolution images. It's designed to recover finer textures and details that are often lost in standard interpolation methods.
